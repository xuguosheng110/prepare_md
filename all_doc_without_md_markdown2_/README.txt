Environment Initialization


$ yarn


This command will install the necessary plugins.

Development


$ yarn start


This command will start a local development server and open a browser window. Most changes are reflected in real-time without the need to restart the server.

Compilation


$ yarn build


This command will generate static content in the "build" directory, which can be used with any static content hosting service. After compilation, it is not supported to directly open .html files for viewing. Use npm run serve to start the service.

Error Handling


If the environment initialization using yarn fails, try upgrading yarn to the latest version

npm install yarn@latest -g

If starting the local development server with yarn start fails, try upgrading the nodejs version

Install the n module


sudo npm install -g n

Upgrade nodejs to the specified version

sudo n nodeversionnumber

Check the nodejs version (need to restart the terminal)

node -v
